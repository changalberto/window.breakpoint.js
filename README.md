window.breakpoint.js
====================

Custom window resize event. The breakpoint event is fired at each defined breakpoint very much like mediaqueries are triggered. This custom event is great purpose for hybrid responsive/adaptive designs, where javascript functionality needs to be enabled or disabled at different breakpoints.
